--[## DRIVING ##]--

27.2 Drivers are strictly forbidden to drive their car in the opposite direction to the race unless this is absolutely necessary in order to move the car from a dangerous position.

27.3 During	practice and the race, drivers may use only the track and must at all times observe the provisions of the Code relating to driving behaviour on circuits.

27.4 Drivers must make every reasonable effort to use the track at all times and may not deliberately leave the track without a justifiable reason.
	 Drivers will be judged to have left the track if no part of the car remains in contact with it and for the avoidance of doubt, any white lines defining the track edges are considered to be part of the track but the kerbs are not.
	 Should a car leave the track the driver may re-join, however, this may only be done when it is safe to do so and without gaining any lasting advantage. At the absolute discretion of the games penalty system, a driver may be given the opportunity to give back the whole of any
	 advantage he/she gained by leaving the track.

	 Gran Turismo Sport - Slowing down so the penalty timer can count down


27.5 At	no time may a car be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed potentially trolling to other players. 
	 This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track the pit entry or the pit lane.
	 
27.6 More than one change of direction to defend a position is not permitted. Any player moving back towards the racing line, having earlier defended his position off-line, should leave at least	
	 one car width between his own car and the edge of the track on the approach to the corner.
