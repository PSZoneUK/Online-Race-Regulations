--[## 8 DRIVING ##]--

8.1 
   Players are strictly forbidden to drive their car in the opposite direction to the race unless this is absolutely necessary in order
   to move the car from a dangerous position.

8.2 
   During practice and the race, players may use only the track and must at all times observe the provisions of the Code relating
   to driving behaviour on circuits.

8.3 
   Players must make every reasonable effort to use the track at all times and may not deliberately leave the 
   track without a justifiable reason.
   
   Players will be judged to have left the track if no part of the car remains in contact with it and for the avoidance of doubt, any 
   white lines defining the track edges are considered to be part of the track but the kerbs are not.

   Should a car leave the track the player may re-join, however, this may only be done when it is safe to do so and without gaining
   any lasting advantage. At the absolute discretion of the games penalty system, a player may be given the opportunity to give back 
   the whole of any advantage he/she gained by leaving the track.

8.4 
   At no time may a car be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be
   deemed potentially trolling to other players. 
   This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track the pit entry or the pit lane.
   

8.5 
   More than one change of direction to defend a position is not permitted. Any player moving back towards the racing line,
   having earlier defended his position off-line, should leave at least	
   one car width between his own car and the edge of the track on the approach to the corner.


8.6 
   Any player defending his position on a straight, and before any braking area, may use the full width of the track during his / hers
   first move, provided no significant portion of the car attempting to pass is alongside his / hers.
   Whilst defending in this way the player may not leave the track without justifiable reason.
   For the avoidance of doubt, if any part of the front of the car attempting to pass is alongside the rear wheel of the car in front
   this will be deemed to be a ‘significant portion’.
    

8.7 
   Manoeuvres liable to hinder other players, such as deliberate crowding of a car beyond
   the edge of the track or any other abnormal change of direction, are not permitted.


8.8 [Applies to games with Blue Flag System] 
   As soon as a car is caught by another car which is about to lap it during the race the player must allow the faster player past at the
   first available opportunity. If the player who has been caught does not allow the faster player past, waved blue flags will be shown
   to indicate that he / she must allow the following player to overtake.
