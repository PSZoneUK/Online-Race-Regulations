# Online Race Regulations
We all like clean racing and wheel to wheel action, so here is our chance to make the regulations for online racing so we can all enjoy clean racing online.

Until I can find a more sutiable place to host this, you will find it here until further notice. Additions will be made through the Offical Playstation Forum by how many kudos a addition recieves to stop an influx of new users to this site just for this. Only suggestions approved by the community will make it into the next version revision.
